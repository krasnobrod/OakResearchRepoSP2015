<scenarioName>_<dataElement>.<extension>

where 

<scenarioName> 

   is the name used in generating the file. These names are based on the name 
   used to define the scenarios. 
     "currentClim" outputs are based on the 1961-1990 climate normals as outlined on
     the http://forest.moscowfsl.wsu.edu/climate/current web page. 
     
     The other names are are described on the future climate page: 
     http://forest.moscowfsl.wsu.edu/climate/future
   
   The surface coefficent files used depend on the model extent you selected. See
   http://forest.moscowfsl.wsu.edu/climate/details.php for an explaination.

<dataElement> is one of the following for point data:
                                        
   "m" signifies average monthly minimum temperature degrees C
   "t" signifies monthly mean temperature degrees C
   "x" signifies average monthly maximum temperature degrees C
   "p" signifies total monthly precipation in mm 
   "derived" signifies that the derived data are output (see below). 

<dataElement> is one of the following for grid data:

    "map"         Mean annual precipitation
    "mat_tenths"  Mean annual temperature in tenths of degrees C
    "mmax_tenths" Mean maximum temperature in the warmest month tenths of degrees C
    "mmin_tenths" Mean minimum temperature in the coldest month tenths of degrees C
    "mmindd0"     Degree-days <0 degrees C (based on mean minimum monthly temperature)
    "mtcm_tenths" Mean temperature in the coldest month tenths of degrees C
    "mtwm_tenths" Mean temperature in the warmest month tenths of degrees C 
    "sday"        Julian date of the last freezing date of spring
    "smrpb"       Summer precipitation balance: (jul+aug+sep)/(apr+may+jun)
    "smrsprpb"    Summer/Spring precipitation balance: (jul+aug)/(apr+may)
    "sprp"        Spring precipitation (apr+may)
    "smrp"        Summer precipitation (jul+aug)
    "winp"        Winter precipitation (nov+dec+jan+feb)

<extension> can be one of:
   
   "log" is the output log generated by ANUSPLIN. We advise that everyone
   look at this file for obvious errors. 
   
   "txt", where <dataElement> is one of "m", "t", "x", or "p":
   
      Columns 1-20 are "field 1": A record identificaition.
      Field 2: Longitude in decimal degrees
      Field 3: Latitude in decimal degrees
      Field 4: Elevation in m
      Fields 5-16: One value for each month.
      
   "txt", where <dataElement> is "derived". Note that all temperatures are in 
   degrees C, variable names are as in Rehfeldt et al 2006. This file has 
   a header record labeling the column names.

      Many other variables can be computed from these, good examples are:
     
      adi Annual dryness index, dd5/map or sqrt(dd5)/map (once named ami, annual moisture index)
      sdi Summer dryness index, dd5/gsp[ or gsdd5/gsp (once named smi, summer moisture index)
      pratio Ratio of summer precipitatioin to total precipitation, gsp/map  
     
   "txt", where the data is grid data, the file is a ascii grid with one line of data
   for each row of the map. The file contains standard header records as described at
   http://docs.codehaus.org/display/GEOTOOLS/ArcInfo+ASCII+Grid+format
